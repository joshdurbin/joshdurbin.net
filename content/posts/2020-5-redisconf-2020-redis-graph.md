[RedisConf 2020](http://redisconf.com) just came to a close. This year the talks/speakers had a lot of great content. RedisLabs is really
investing in modules and out reach to drum up support and usage of their enterprise and open source solutions around Redis.

There are two videos I found very, very informative and another that was a good runner-up.

The first is "A Practical Introduction to RedisGraph", by [Guy Royse](https://twitter.com/guyroyse).

The second is a deeper dive into what's happening under the hood; "RedisGraph 2.2: The Fastest Way to Query Your Highly Connected Data in Redis", by [Roi Lipman](https://twitter.com/roilipman).
