## Update

Dec 8th, 2017: Chase recently [made a change](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnyjet/2017/09/12/can-you-own-the-chase-sapphire-preferred-sapphire-reserve-at-the-same-time/#214cf846f7ed) disallowing a single customer
from benefiting from rewards on both a Sapphire Preferred and Sapphire
Reserve card. Boo. Anyway, that changes the potential bonus gain in this article by about a 1/3. Their
Sapphire Credit products are still great for you and your spouse, though!

## Twenty-five percent return on spending w/ Chase

Back in May, I switched from a once local, now remote credit union with poor consumer banking tech to Chase.
Since then I've become a little too obsessed with maximizing bonus rewards for Chases credit card products.
I thought I'd share a summary of what folks can do to gain about three thousand dollars in travel rewards
for $12,000 in spending -- about a %25 return on purchases.

The following involves opening 4 cards for two people (3 for you) in the same household. The hard/soft credit
pulls generally only adversely affect credit by about 10-15 points, which rebound once the pulls expire. The
actions also assume you would have already spent the $12,000 over 9 months on other accounts or debit cards, etc...

Action   | Points  | Cash
---------|----------|-------
Open [Chase Sapphire Preferred Card](https://creditcards.chase.com/sapphire-credit-cards) and spend $4,000.00 in 3 months | 50,000 |
Minimum point gain for spending $4,000.00 | >=4,000 |
Open [Chase Sapphire Reserve Card](https://creditcards.chase.com/sapphire-credit-cards) ||
Sapphire Reserve Annual Fee hits on first billing cycle || -$450
Travel Credit (Lyft, Virgin America, United, etc...) || $300
Global Entry / TSA Precheck || ~$150
Spend $4,000.00 in 3 months (including spending that is covered by travel credit / Global Entry / TSA Pre coverage | 50,000 |
Minimum point gain for spending $4,000.00 | >=4,000 |
Open [Chase Freedom Card](https://creditcards.chase.com/freedom-credit-cards) and spend $500 in 3 months | 15,000 |
Minimum point gain for spending $500.00 | >=500 |
Refer spouse to Chase Sapphire (Preferred) card | 10,000 |
Spend $4,000.00 in 3 months on spouse's card | 50,000 |
Minimum point gain for spending $4,000.00 on spouse's card | >= 4,000 |
Combine, transfer points across accounts including spouses in the same household to Sapphire Reserve card. Points on the Sapphire Reserve card are worth 1.5x when used for travel via Chase's site. | -187,500 | $2812.50

...and there you go: **~$2800** (likely more with purchase bonuses) in travel credit for $12,000 in purchases.

## Assumptions

- You and your spouse were going to spend $12,000 via revolving lines of credit in 9 months
- You are looking to gain from Global Entry or TSA Pre-check via credit card perks

## Caveats

- Be sure to migrate or use points before you close accounts such that they don't burn on re-entry to the bank
- Close accounts used for bonus gain before annual fees strike the next year
- It's worth keeping the Sapphire Reserve around for a year given it's elevated point collection program and that points from other accounts can be transferred to it and leveraged for more value

Then go on vacation! :-)
