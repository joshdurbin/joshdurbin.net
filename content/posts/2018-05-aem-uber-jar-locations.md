Old-ish news, AEM 6.4 is [out](https://helpx.adobe.com/support/experience-manager/6-4.html).

If you're developing and looking for a quick project start, be sure and check
out [sdkman!](http://sdkman.io) and use sdkman to install [lazybones](https://github.com/pledbrook/lazybones).
Then, with `lazybones`, create an `aem-multimodule-project` templated project and follow the prompts.

It couldn't be easier (for small projects, at least)!

### Repos
