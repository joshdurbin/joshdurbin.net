This was a fun bit; using [Apache Tika](https://tika.apache.org/) to detect MIME types of files on your machine
with little code and effort. The script takes a location, the root location from which to
recurse, and generates a set of absolute paths to scrutinize. It then establishes a latch equal to
the size of the set to block reporting until the analysis is complete. The script then
iterates through the absolute paths, submitting jobs to the executor for processing, which each 
hold a reference to a thread safe map and counter object use for tallying.

Throw the script a large directory and watch it run!

Tika is super useful in pre-processing steps, data pipelines, when input type guarantees
are critical. 

```groovy
#!/usr/bin/env groovy

@Grapes([
    @Grab(group='org.apache.tika', module='tika-core', version='1.18')
])

import org.apache.tika.Tika

import java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap
import java.util.concurrent.Executors
import java.util.concurrent.atomic.LongAdder
import java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch

import static groovy.io.FileType.FILES

def cli = new CliBuilder(header: 'MIME Type Reporter', usage:'./mimeReporter <directoryToScan>', width: 100)

def cliOptions = cli.parse(args)

if (cliOptions.help || cliOptions.arguments().size() != 1) {
  cli.usage()
  System.exit(0)
}

def results = new ConcurrentHashMap()
def fileAbsolutePaths = []
def tika = new Tika()
def executor = Executors.newWorkStealingPool()

new File(cliOptions.arguments().first()).eachFileRecurse(FILES) { file ->
  fileAbsolutePaths << file.absolutePath
}

def latch = new CountDownLatch(fileAbsolutePaths.size())

println "Processing ${fileAbsolutePaths.size()} files..."

fileAbsolutePaths.each { filePath ->
  executor.submit {
    try {
      results.computeIfAbsent(tika.detect(new File(filePath)), { k -> new LongAdder() }).increment()
    } finally {
      latch.countDown()
    }
  }
}

latch.await()
executor.shutdown()

def formatOutput = '%-40s occurred %d times%n' 

results.each { contentType, counter ->
  System.out.format(formatOutput, contentType, counter.intValue())
}
```

That script run on a relatively fresh AEM 6.4 author install (with SP1), yields the following
reported MIME Types:
