[Migadu](https://www.migadu.com/en/index.html) is a great e-mail hosting provider for those on a budget. Especially the budget
of free. Migadu is one of the few, in my opinion, good provider in a space with a million shit-contenders that offer
reasonable hosting for private domains. Before I migrated to [Fastmail]() I used Migadu for my mail.

They have a dandy [what's good](https://www.migadu.com/en/benefits.html) and honest to goodness [what's bad](https://www.migadu.com/en/drawbacks.html) about their platform.

Also checkout my [Terraform Module](https://registry.terraform.io/modules/joshdurbin/migadu-route53-mail/aws/0.0.1) for setting up Migadu
mail with your AWS-hosted Route53 zones!

Cheers!
