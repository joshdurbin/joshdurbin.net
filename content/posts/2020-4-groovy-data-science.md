Back in the fall of 2019 [Paul King](https://objectcomputing.com/products/2gm-team#king), of [Object Computing](https://objectcomputing.com), gave a really compelling
overview of using Groovy and JVM-ecosystem for Data Science applications. The presentation is absolutely packed full of data science principles at a high level and
frameworks and tools that aid in data preparation and analysis. It's worth thumbing though!
